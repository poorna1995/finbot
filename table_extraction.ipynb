Additionally, Equity through other comprehensive income saw a reduction due to fair value changes in investments and cash flow hedges.

Key growth components include higher income tax and stock compensation expenses. In contrast, investment activities showcased elevated volatility as cash used increased from (1,209) crore to (5,009) crore, largely due to higher outflows in mutual funds and certificates of deposit.

Despite the decrease in total gross carrying value, the accumulated depreciation reduced from ₹17,470 crore to ₹16,743 crore, thanks in part to the removal of depreciated assets. This resulted in a net increase in the carrying value from ₹13,067 crore to ₹13,346 crore.

Additionally, translation differences have dramatically decreased from 423 to just 55 by the end of the current period. Finally, there is a slight increase in the carrying value at the end of the period from 7,248 to 7,303.

The total ROU asset value increased from ₹4,823 crore to ₹6,882 crore. This marked rise of ₹2,059 crore primarily stems from substantial additions in the buildings and computers categories, amounting to ₹847 crore and ₹2,646 crore respectively.

Operating expenses generally decreased, especially in Life Sciences, leading to a positive shift in profitability. Financial Services experienced a notable increase in segment operating income, growing from 1,941 crore to 2,600 crore. The net profit before tax decreased significantly from 10,240 crore to 8,466 crore, largely influenced by a substantial reduction in other income and an increase in total expenses.

Expenses generally decreased, with identifiable operating expenses dropping from 89,877 crore to 84,993 crore, and allocated expenses from 27,368 crore to 26,644 crore. Despite these expense reductions, the net profit dipped from 26,248 crore to 24,108 crore, indicating a possible reduction in operational efficiency or other factors. Finance cost saw a notable decrease which improved the financial health slightly.
