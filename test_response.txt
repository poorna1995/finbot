>>> User Question: What was the total spending on selling and marketing expenses for the year ending March 31, 2024, compared to the previous year?
>>> Time taken for query: 6.65 seconds.
>>> Response: To calculate the total spending on selling and marketing expenses for the year ending March 31, 2024, and compare it to the previous year, we need to extract the relevant data from the table provided.

From the table:
- Selling and marketing expenses are not explicitly mentioned in the table. Therefore, we cannot directly provide the exact spending on selling and marketing expenses.

However, we can make an assumption that the total spending on selling and marketing expenses is included in the total expenses or costs mentioned in the table. To calculate the total expenses for the year ending March 31, 2024, and the previous year, we can sum up the expenses for each geography:

2024 Total Expenses = Total of 2024 North America + 2024 Europe + 2024 India + 2024 Rest of the world
2023 Total Expenses = Total of 2023 North America + 2023 Europe + 2023 India + 2023 Rest of the world

2024 Total Expenses = (92,411 + 42,267 + 3,881 + 15,111) crore
2023 Total Expenses = (90,724 + 37,675 + 3,861 + 14,507) crore

Calculate the total expenses for both years and then compare them to determine the difference in total spending on selling and marketing expenses for the year ending March 31, 2024, compared to the previous year.

>>> User Question: How did general and administration expenses vary between FY 2023 and FY 2024?
>>> Time taken for query: 11.10 seconds.
>>> Response: To calculate the variance in general and administration expenses between FY 2023 and FY 2024, we need to consider the relevant values from the table provided.

In the table, the general and administration expenses are categorized under "Other expenses." We need to sum up the values for each fiscal year separately and then find the difference to determine the variance.

For FY 2023:
- Total general and administration expenses = 331 + 46 + 265 + 78 + 41 + 43 + (-80) + 0 + 86 + 151 + 181 = 1,146

For FY 2024:
- Total general and administration expenses = 1,278 + 199 + 1,007 + 326 + 170 + 210 + 75 + 16 + 121 + 533 + 781 = 4,716

Now, calculate the variance:
Variance = FY 2024 total expenses - FY 2023 total expenses
Variance = 4,716 - 1,146
Variance = 3,570

Therefore, the variance in general and administration expenses between FY 2023 and FY 2024 is $3,570.

>>> Time taken for query: 5.25 seconds.
>>> Response: To calculate the profit for the period for FY 2024 compared to FY 2023, we need to look at the "Profit for the period" figures for both years.

For FY 2024:
Profit for the period = $7,975 million

Substitute the values:
Profit difference = $7,975 million - $6,134 million
Profit difference = $1,841 million

Therefore, the profit for the period for FY 2024 is $1,841 million higher than FY 2023.
